<h2>What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?</h2>
<p>Interface and Type are the most common things that used Typescript. Both types and interfaces allows developers to create reusable structures for variables, function parameters, return types, and more. But there is some difference in Interface and Type. Also we use Type and Interface in different cases <br>

<b>Here are three major difference between Type and Interface</b> <br>

1.Types in TypeScript are more flexible and can define primitive, intersection, union, tuple, or different types of data, while interfaces are used to describe the shape of an object. <br>

2.Interface can be declared multiple times and will merge.Type cannot be re-declared it will throw an error. <br>

3.interface cannot create union types.Type can easily create union or intersection types.

<p><br>
<p>
There are also difference in declering Interface and Type

<pre>
<code>

// way to define interface
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

//way to defint type
type Age = number;

</code>
</pre>
</p><br>
<p>
<b>There are four best ways to use Interface and Type:</b>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use interface to define object shapes.</li>
  <li>Use type for unions and intersections.</li>
  <li>Use type when working with primitives or tuples.</li>
  <li>Use interface when implementing with classes.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In conclusion, both <b>interface</b> and <b>type</b> are powerful features in TypeScript that help in writing cleaner and more maintainable code. Understanding when to use each can improve your coding efficiency and make your codebase easier to manage.

<h2>How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?</h2>
<p>
TypeScript is a powerful, open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions, which help developers catch errors early and write more reliable code. TypeScript is widely used in modern web development projects because it improves code quality, enhances tooling, and makes large codebases easier to manage and scale.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>There are four points explaining how TypeScript helps improve code quality</b>
Early Error Detection: TypeScript catches type-related errors during development, reducing runtime bugs. <br>

Clear Code Structure: With interfaces, types, and classes, TypeScript enforces organized and consistent code. <br>

Improved Readability: Type annotations make it easier for developers to understand the purpose and behavior of code. <br>

Better Tooling Support: TypeScript enables intelligent code completion, navigation, and refactoring in modern IDEs.<br>
